1) As a teacher/parent I want to be able to get a report on a particular student so I can see his/her progress.
 - The report should tell me if the student is getting faster overall at answering questions compared to previous results.
 - The report should tell me how fast the student answers questions on addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
 - The report should tell me how fast the student is at addition, subtraction, multiplication and division compared to other students in the class. 
	For example, above average on addition, below average on subtraction etc
 - The report should list the tables the student is strong in. For example, student is good at eight times tables
 - The report should list the tables the student is weak in. For example, student needs improvement in the eight times tables.

2) As a teacher I want to be able to get a report on a the entire class so I can see the class's progress.
 - I want the report to tell me if the class are getting faster or slower on average each time they use the app.
 - I want the report to rank the students from fastest to slowest and list their best and worst tables.
 - In this report I want the report to tell me what tables the class are fast at answering on average and what tables the class is slow at answering.

3) As a student I want to see a report on my results after using the app.
 - The report should show the student's overall progress compared to previous times on the app.
 - The app should list the tables the student is strong in.
 - The app should list the tables the student needs to improve upon.

In order to produce the reports the following information needs to be stored:

the name of the student
the date/time/session when the student played the game
the questions the student was asked during that game session
the time it took to get the correct answer for each question

The code needs to be able to produce the following analysis:

The average speed of the student at answering questions
The average speed of the student at answering overall questions on addition
The average speed of the student at answering overall questions on multiplication
The average speed of the student at answering overall questions on subtraction
The average speed of the student at answering overall questions on division
The average speed of the student at answering specific questions on each of the tables
For example, the student's speed on questions from the four times tables and the five subtraction tables should be calculated.
The code needs to determine if a student's knowledge of a table needs more work based on the speed with which the student answered questions on that table.
The code needs to be able to rank the students by the speed at which they answered the questions.
