MySQL

You must install MySQL and have root permission. Run ‘MySQL command line client’. Create a database called ‘mathrun’ for project to use. You also need to create a “test” user to let web service application access database. All can be done by following code
1.	mysql> CREATE DATABASE mathrun;
2.	mysql> CREATE USER ‘test’@’localhost’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘test’;
3.	mysql> GRANT ALL ON car.* TO ‘test’@’localhost’;

Maven 

Make sure that Maven 3.X.X is installed in your PC. 
1.	Follow tutorial to install Maven
2.	Go to local maven repository folder (C:\Users\YourUsername\.m2)
3.	Copy settings.xml from mathrun\resources\settings.xml into C:\Users\YourUsername\.m2
4.	Open command window and change directory to car-web-service project home (in which pom.xml exists). Run ‘mvn clean package’.
5.	Built package is in 'mathrun\target\mathrun.war'

JBoss

Jboss is chosen to be the web service container in the runtime. “jboss-eap-6.4.0.zip” file is accessible to download from Yujie’s Google Drive link. You can also download latest JBoss EAP version if you have Jboss account. Configuration settings are as follows
1.	Unzip JBoss EAP package i.e. “jboss-eap-6.4.0.zip” and change directory to jboss-eap-6.4 (called JBOSS_HOME)
2.	Install mysql module by copying mathrun\resources\mysql.7z to JBOSS_HOME\modules\system\layers\base
3.	Unzip mysql.7z in JBOSS_HOME\modules\system\layers\base directory
4.	Check JBOSS_HOME\modules\system\layers\base\com\mysql\main folder has one jar file and one xml file. If not, you didn’t unzip correctly in step 3
5.	Copy mathrun\resources\standalone.xml to JBOSS_HOME\standalone\configuration directory. It is safe to overwrite existing file.
6.	Run a command window and change directory to JBOSS_HOME\bin. Start JBOSS EAP 6.4 by typing standalone.bat
7.	When JBoss is running correctly, copy 'mathrun\target\mathrun.war' and paste in JBOSS_HOME\standalone\deployment. A 'mathrun.war.isdeploying' file should be generated by JBoss and soon turned to 'mathrun.war.deployed' which is an indication of successful deployment
