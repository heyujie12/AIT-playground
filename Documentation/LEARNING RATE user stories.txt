1. As a child, I expect system to apply machine learning algorithms to increase and decrease difficulty level in game so that questions are "suitable" to my knowledge. Definition of suitable is as follows
	1.1 increase difficulty level if I am capable of answering two questions within half of given time span
	1.2 stay in the same difficulty level if I am capable of answering questions in ordinary pace
	1.3 increase difficulty level if I am capable of answering five questions in a row
	1.4. decrease difficulty level if I fail to answer two questions in a row

2. As a child, I can view and sense the difficult level in game.
	2.1 character moves faster and sound becomes more intense when level increases. 
	2.2 character moves slower and sound becomes softer when level decreases
	2.3 character stays in the same pace as he/she progresses in the same level 

3. As a child, I shall feel challenged if difficult level increases. Average response time and average accurate rate are means to measure
	3.1 Response time shall fall in between 10% and 30% increase compared to the lower level
	3.2 Accurate rate shall drop 5% up to 15% compared to the lower lever
